\markup \bold { Cumberland Nellie }
\markup \wordwrap {
  Hereâ€™s a very old English tune dating back to at least the latter half of the seventeenth century. It was attached to a number of ballads, perhaps most notably The North Country Lovers which begins, 'There was a lass of Cumberland.'

\markup \bold { The New Road to Alston }
\markup \wordwrap {
  Victorian-era musicologist Frank Kidson noted that Alston, at the time of his writing, was a "wild and remote district of Cumberland," although it had a significant lead-mining industry in the 19th century. The inventor of modern road-building, John Macadam, made a road to Alston from Penrith in the early 1800s. Kidson found the melody is from a Northumbrian piper's MS of about 1816. Knowles thinks the tune has "more of a French feel to it." Malcolm Douglas identifies it as a relative of "Davy Davy Knick Knack."

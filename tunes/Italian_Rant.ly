  Stewart Hardy writes: This cracking melody makes its first appearance in Playfordâ€™s Dancing Master in 1657 but it had already been around since the sixteenth-century in a hugely popular Italian ballad known as 'La Mantovana'. The tune spread throughout European folk traditions, was picked up by classical composers and even found its way into the Israeli national anthem.
